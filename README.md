## Go-batchHander

Note: This tool is designed for education and research cases, and it shouldn't be used as a tool to check the finality status of your transation, for more reasons, please check `Warning` [below](#Warning).

If you are looking for a way to check your transaction's finality, please refer to [parent-chain-confirmation-checker](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/parent-chain-confirmation-checker)

### Import nitro
Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jason-W123/go-batchhandler.git
cd go-batchhandler
```

Clone submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive --force
```

Enter nitro:
```bash
cd nitro
```

Build necessary libs:
```bash
make contracts
make build-node-deps
```

### Build

```bash
go build -o batchtool src/*
```

(Note: If you get this error `link: github.com/fjl/memsize: invalid reference to runtime.stopTheWorld` when build the code, please refer to [this pr](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/363/files) to fix.)

### Simple example

```bash
./batchtool decodebatch --child-chain-id 42161 --parent-chain-node-url {ParentChain_Enpoint} --parent-chain-submission-tx-hash {Parent_Chain_Submission_Tx-Hash} --blob-client.beacon-url {Blob_Enpoint}
```

### Warning
This repository may query incorrect transaction hashes. This can occur due to the potential for malicious behavior from the Sequencer.

**Malicious Sequencer Behavior:** If a malicious Sequencer exists on the network, it could include invalid transactions (e.g., transactions with incorrect nonces) within a batch.

**Impact on different Hash querying:** The inclusion of invalid transactions by a malicious Sequencer will result in a different hash results compared to the honest fullnode, because honest fullnode will simply ignore this transation that and you can't query it from their endpoint.


### Limitation

Since this util is stateless, so it can't retrieve every transaction types including: `redeem transaction from retryables`

`redeem transaction from retryables` will show up only if the auto-redeem success, if it not, the tx will not be recorded on blockchain. So to check the tx can be executed successfully or not, we need to get the state of the blockchain to verify it.


But those tx can be retrieved by some walkaround ways and will be supported in this repo later.

### Execution Options:

For `decodebatch`:
```
Usage of batchHandler:
      --blob-client.authorization string          Value to send with the HTTP Authorization: header for Beacon REST requests, must include both scheme and scheme parameters
      --blob-client.beacon-url string             Beacon Chain RPC URL to use for fetching blobs (normally on port 3500)
      --blob-client.blob-directory string         Full path of the directory to save fetched blobs
      --blob-client.secondary-beacon-url string   Backup beacon Chain RPC URL to use for fetching blobs (normally on port 3500) when unable to fetch from primary
      --child-chain-id uint                       Child chain id
      --parent-chain-node-url string              URL for parent chain node
      --parent-chain-submission-tx-hash string    The batch submission transaction hash
```

For `retrieveFromDAS`
    Not supported yet.
